		<h1> You slam the door open and are greeted by a cold, musty store room.</h1>
		<h2> The room must not have seen use commercial use in many years. Candles can be seen rotting away, some even molding.
			Pieces of what must have been cloth were settled on a table in the center of the room.
			But oddly enough, one sole candle was lit in the room. It took stand on what must've been the merchants table of business.
			You take some tentative steps forward, despite the candle the room is still dark. 
			The windows in the front of the shop providing very little light into the store.
			You grab the candle and take it with you.
			<br>
			Sounds of somebody shuffling objects grabs your attention, it sounds like it's coming from the back.
			<br><br>
			When you approach the back room, it's empty. As you step in your candle light reveals an open trap door.
			You extend your candle into it, but all it reveals is a ladder extending down into the darkness.

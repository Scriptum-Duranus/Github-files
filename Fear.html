	<h1> You step away from the trap door. </h1>
	<h2> A chill runs down your spine, something about this place irks you. 
	Something beyond the darkness. You retreat to the door that led into the backroom.
	<br>
	But the door is locked.
	<br>
	You set the candle down and bang against the door with all your might, but the door holds.
	You even draw your sword and attempt to attack the door, but the blade is deflected.
	<br>
	If you weren't sure before, now you absolutely knew that something was going on.
	<br>
	And youre only way forward is through the trapdoor. You retrieve your candle and prepare yourself.

		<h1>Your name is Hillary Heavangarde.</h1>
		<h2> You took after your mother and became a guard for the city you grew up.
		She herself taught you how to wield a sword and who to use it for.
		The town bustles with activity before you,
		people scurry left and right trading goods for various coins.
		<br>
		A typical day really.</h2>
		</p>
		<p><h2> You briefly admire the clouds before returning to your work. 
		The town was typically very quiet and today was no exception.
		You make your way down the market area, keeping an eye on a few of the shiftier people who frequented this area.
		<br>
		But an unfamilar girl is who catches your eye today.
		<br>
		Her smock seemed so ancient that something seemed to be growing out of it. 
		Her hair was long and unkept, various bits of nature occupying parts of her head space.
		Everybody around her seems to be ignoring her very existence.
		Once spots you staring at her, she dissapears down an alley.

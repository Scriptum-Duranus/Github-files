	<h1> You continue your watch.

	<h2>But all the time the girl plague's your thoughts.
	It wasn't even the girl's peculiar looks that caught your eye.
	<br>
	It was the fact she looked so familiar. She definitely wasn't a part of your family,
	but some how her face frightened you.
	You decide that maybe it's best if you do indeed follow her. So you retrace your steps and go about seeing if you can find where she may have left to.
	<br>Surprisingly, she was standing right around the corner you had seen her turn around before.
	She had barely moved after rounding it, but once she saw you finally follow, she quickly gathers herself and runs off.
